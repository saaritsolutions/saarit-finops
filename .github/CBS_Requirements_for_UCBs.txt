Introduction

Core Banking Solution (CBS) adoption is completed by commercial banks in India. Though the
Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) have also been working towards implementation of CBS, there
are still many UCBs that are not under CBS. Even in regard to the UCBs that adopted CBS, there
are concerns about completeness and security.
The CBS of UCBs contains key modules for customer information, online transaction processing
of deposit and loan accounts and the reports required for regulatory compliance and day-to-day
operations. However, there are issues in some of the modules especially relating to generation
of regulatory reports. Further, there are challenges in interfacing CBS with payment systems of
the country.
In order to attain a minimum degree of completeness of the solution with adequate security
features, RBI has advised IDRBT to prepare a document detailing the requirements of a CBS for a
UCB. It is quite relevant in the case of UCBs in view of the paucity of expertise relating to
implementation of technology projects and vendor management in many of the UCBs.
IDRBT has prepared this document detailing the requirements of CBS in the case of UCBs. The
inputs of functional and technical experts of CBS have been obtained for preparation of this
document. The document is vetted by a few UCBs (with both unit and multi-branch) that
already has CBS implementation.
A Pilot Project at Idukki, Kerala for a UCB has ensured that
the documented requirements are implementable.
In order to make the document comprehensive, requirements for remittances, asset liability
management, reports for anti-money laundering, human resources management, fixed asset
management, treasury and investments, safe deposit lockers have also been included. While
details of functional requirements are presented in Annexure I, technical details are given in
Annexure II.
Many of the CBS implementations by UCBs are cloud based. In order to help UCBs to be better
prepared for such outsourcing and to get best out of cloud services, guidelines for leveraging
cloud computing are detailed in Annexure III.
The document is expected to serve as a reference document for any UCB that is implementing
CBS by an internal team or an external vendor. The document would be useful even in the case
of change requests, system modifications, vendor management and contract finalization. Though
the document is prepared for UCB, this may be leveraged by DCCB, SCB, Payment and Small
Finance Banks to scope their functional and technical requirements.
Apart from the minimum common requirements given in this document, banks have to factor
their specific requirements. They also need to plan for new requirements that may come due to
changing customer and regulatory needs while deploying CBS.

Functional Requirements

Most of the UCBs CBS is one stop solution for meeting the Branch banking operations as well as
other functions like Head office needs, asset liability management, remittances, anti-money
laundering, bank staff management, etc. If the UCBs are large and multi-state, they could deploy
separate modules/software for asset liability management, anti-money laundering, remittances,
staff management, etc., surrounding core banking. The functionality requirements of UCBs can
be broadly categorized into CBS and its peripherals, payment channels and surround applications.

III.

Technical Requirements

The technology requirements are important for ensuring availability, performance, scalability
and security of the UCB CBS.

RBI's report of “Working Group on Information Security,

Electronic Banking, Technology Risk Management and Cyber Frauds” is exhaustive for ensuring
security needs for a bank. ISO 27000 series, OWASP, PCI and PA DSS and IDRBT's “Information
Security Framework for Indian Banking Industry” based on the guidance from various security
practitioners of Indian Banks serve as references for ensuring IT security in the banks.
Core Banking Solution Requirements for Urban Cooperative
Banks: Functional and Technical

Page 7 of 112

UCBs should ensure applications/software being hosted are thoroughly tested and pass
Vulnerability and Penetration testing done by CERT-IN/STQC approved organizations. VAPT has
to be done at prescribed regular intervals/also, UCBs leveraging Cloud computing model for CBS
and other IT applications can refer to the “IDRBT Cloud Security for Indian Banks” for the contract
documents with the service provider. Detailed technical requirements for UCB applications are
presented in Annexure II.
The technical requirements are classified as
1) Performance, Availability and Scalability Requirements
2) IT Security Requirements
UCBs have been adopting CBS using cloud services. Keeping in view the requirements relating to
cloud model, in the Annexure III, key areas that have to be looked into CBS on cloud computing
are described. The Working Group on Cloud computing option for small size UCBs from RBI
provides a precautionary direction on leveraging cloud services. IDRBT's Cloud Security
Framework for Indian Banks provides guidelines for cloud adoption in IaaS, PaaS and SaaS model.
UCBs planning to leverage cloud service providers(CSP) for CBS and their other needs need to
ensure the CSP adhere to the above mentioned security requirement and also provide a written
proof that any PII or customer data will not be stored outside India. Banks should test the process
for complete data removal from cloud service provider as part of UAT. If there is a situation of
exit, Bank should obtain the data and have written proof that data is completely destroyed from
the service provider location.
IV.

Legal and HR Requirements

As the cooperative banks have lean IT skilled staff and have offices in towns and tier II/III/IV urban
areas, recruitment and retention of skilled IT resources is a challenge. It is prudent for UCBs to
leverage established ASPs/Data centers/Cloud Service Providers(CSP) for the IT services and to
meet availability requirements. If, for any reason the ASP/CSP is unable to provide such service
offerings, the Bank should have the right to go to other Service Providers in which case the
current ASP shall extend necessary co-operation and assistance, beyond providing an interface
patch, to integrate the new service line with the existing infrastructure and applications of the
ASP. UCB should reserve the option to ask the ASP to arrange for all additional third party
applications / tools / hardware in order to bring the entire additional service line under ASP
model. For better interactions with outsourced/Cloud service providers, UCBs should have
resources with strong project management skills that includes vendor management and project
planning capabilities. IDRBT Vendor Management Framework provides a guidance for

preparation of contract document along with SLA terms and conditions with the service provider
and UCB.

1. Performance, Availability and Scalability Requirements
•System to meet all present and future functional requirements should be highly
parameterisable and not hardcoded.
•The CBS should be able to process a minimum of 10 (OLTP) transactions per second. This is
applicable for unit banks, however, UCBs with more branches need better concurrency. For
medium/large UCBs, the concurrency should be 40% of the user base and should support 4000
login users.
•A proof of benchmarking of the solution and the hardware sizing for the scale of the branch
should be documented before the implementation. The hardware sizing has to be done with
consent of the application service provider.
•CBS should also support batch operations, EOD and BOD operations. EOD, BOD operations
should be completed within 3 hours on a normal day and within 4 hours during
quarter/halfyear/year ends. All Batch jobs and the running rights should be in control of the
bank authorities with appropriate user rights

Annexure III (Cloud Computing)
RBI Working Group on Cloud computing option for small size UCBs and IDRBT Cloud Security
Framework for Indian Banks and are available as a reference for formulating the requirements
for Cloud Computing for UCBs. The cloud offering normally includes services, infrastructure, and
hosting of application software. The following are some of the areas that are to be factored while
adopting CBS solution services on cloud.:
•Datacentre: The datacentre shall be of minimum level-3 with n+1 redundancy for its
entire infrastructure like HVAC, fire protection systems, ups and so forth. It must be
secure and reliable
•The location of the datacentre is also to be considered while taking cloud services. Its
location must be in a safe and secure place, away from crowded areas, fire hazard prone
areas and high risk seismic zones
•In a cloud computing environment, the software and the customer’s data are hosted by
the vendor, typically in a shared environment and the software configuration is
homogeneous across all of vendor’s customers. This means that cloud application is
generally customizable for common requirements and not for specific requirements.
Hence, buyer must ensure that cloud service provider agrees to provide customization
specific to buyer as and when required through change request mechanism
•The buyer must satisfy himself that the solution is highly available, reliable and fault
tolerant. The buyer must prescribe performance metrics like TPS, response time for each
type of transaction and so forth. The agreement must provide for appropriate service
levels with reference to availability and responsiveness of the application software
(uptime, response time and problem resolution time). It must also state the remedial
measures available and the liquidated damages to be levied if service levels are not
maintained. The buyer should not simply accept default vendor offers on uptime
percentages and measurement period, but negotiate for uptime and its frequency of
measurement to address its business needs and requirements. The shorter measurement
of uptime say once in a month is preferable to longer durations of quarter/half year.
Schedule downtime for maintenance should not affect the availability of services to
buyer’s organization. Any schedule maintenance is to be intimated to the buyer also
•Besides appropriate service levels, the service provider must also agree to resolve issues
pertaining to software and other services in a timely manner so that it does not affect the
business, if necessary by providing acceptable workarounds. If the issue is not addressed
within a reasonable time, there must be a mechanism to escalate the matter to higher
authorities
Core Banking Solution Requirements for Urban Cooperative
Banks: Functional and Technical

Page 107 of 112

•Data security and confidentiality of that customer data are very important in cloud
offers. The buyer must therefore satisfy himself that the procedures adopted by service
provider are adequate to protect data against security vulnerabilities. Hence, the bank
must demand from service provider specific details about data security, specifically
hardware, software and security policies and review them to know that they are in line
with industry standards and security policies of the bank.
•During the contract term, the bank should have the right to gain entry into service
providers’ datacentre and perform through an authorized person/entity, audits of
vendors’ environment, including penetration and security tests, etc.
•Service provider must agree to maintain and run disaster recovery site to ensure
business continuity, in case of any disruption in the primary site. The service provider
must also agree to conduct DR drills at prescribed intervals to test the readiness of
Disaster Recovery Services (DRS)
•In all customer critical solutions like CBS, the service provider must provide adequate
room in the hardware to take care of any sudden spurt in transactions. In order to
facilitate this, the service provider must always ensure that utilization of its hardware
resources are well within 80%. When the utilization exceeds the threshold limit of 80%
for a reasonable period, say a fortnight or a month, the service provider must initiate
steps to enhance/upgrade the hardware in order to avoid untoward incidents
•The bank relies on the service provider as the custodian of its data, and hence service
provider must take backup of customer data at required intervals. The bank must ensure
that service provider’s backup policies are consistent with that of bank’s backup policies
in all critical aspects
•The service provider will have access to customer’s data. The service provider must agree
to maintain confidentiality of such information and that he will not use such information
except for discharging its duties under cloud
•The service provider must grant to the buyer complete right and license to access and
use the software for customer’s business purposes by all its permitted employees and
users. The license may be obtained either on enterprise basis, or per user basis based on
no. of users accessing the software
•The service provider must also guarantee the following:
•All services will be provided in a timely, professional manner to comply with industry
best practices
•Adequate training will be provided to the users on the features and usage of software
•The customers’ data and information will not be shared with or disclosed in any manner
to any third party by the service provider without the consent of buyer
Core Banking Solution Requirements for Urban Cooperative
Banks: Functional and Technical

Page 108 of 112

•The software will not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party
•The software will be free from viruses and other destroying programs.
