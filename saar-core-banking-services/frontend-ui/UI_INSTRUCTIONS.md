# UI Development Guidelines for Saar Core Banking Solution

## 1. Project Structure & Organization
- Use feature-based modules (e.g., Customer, Account, Transaction, etc.)
- Each feature module should contain its own components, services, and models.
- Shared/reusable components and services should be placed in a `shared` module.

## 2. API Integration
- Use Angular services for all HTTP communication with backend microservices.
- Each microservice should have a dedicated Angular service (e.g., `CustomerService`).
- Use environment variables for API base URLs.
- Handle all API errors in services and provide user feedback in components.

## 3. State Management
- Use Angular services and RxJS for simple state management.
- For complex flows or shared state, consider NgRx or Akita.

## 4. UI Components & Layout
- Use Angular Material for consistent, modern UI components.
- Build reusable form controls, tables, dialogs, etc.
- Keep layout and navigation consistent across modules.

## 5. Forms & Validation
- Use Reactive Forms for all data entry.
- Implement strong validation and error messages.
- Keep business logic in services, not components.

## 6. Error Handling & User Feedback
- Centralize error handling in services.
- Use snack bars, dialogs, or notifications for user feedback.

## 7. Security
- Sanitize all user input.
- Use Angularâ€™s built-in security features (HttpClient, DomSanitizer).

## 8. Testing
- Write unit tests for components and services.
- Use end-to-end tests for critical user flows.

## 9. Documentation
- Document all components, services, and APIs.
- Use clear naming conventions and keep code self-explanatory.

## 10. Incremental Integration
- Integrate backend microservices one feature at a time.
- Use mock data/services for features not yet available on the backend.

**Note:**
- Keep the existing layout and structure unless a change is required for maintainability or scalability.
- Always follow clean code and clean architecture principles.
- Review and update this file as the project evolves.
